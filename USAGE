1.) Create a server definition file. Refer to the `servers.example'
    file for more information. Note, that *all* servers in that file
    will be queried sequentially, until the first one answers.

2.) Call rad_auth(user, pw, retries, config) from your program,
    where `user', `pw' and `configs' are char* strings, and retries is
    an integer specifying how many times the authentication should be
    tried. If it fails for the first round, all servers will be tried
    again. Refer to `radauth_test.c' for a complete example.

    return code | meaning
    ------------+----------------------------------------------
        0       | authentication: Accepted
        1       | authentication: Rejected
       -1       | an error happened; look at rad_auth_errstr()
       -2       | no servers could be reached

2a.) If things don't work, re-compile the library with -DDEBUG, or via
    `make clean && make DEBUG=1'. You should get tons of output, then.

3.) Make sure to link in *both* the FreeRADIUS and this library, thus:
    -lfreeradius-radius -lradauth. You may optionally want to specify
    the paths to include and library files via -I/-L.
