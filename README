libradauth
==========

This library is a small wrapper around the authentication routines
provided by the FreeRADIUS server library[1]. It does *not* aim to
be a clever, new RADIUS implementation. Neither does it support
any challenge-response authentication or accounting mechanisms.

It is primarily thought to be used when you have to teach RADIUS
authentication to an LDAP, FTP, News server, etc. If you simply want
to authenticate a username/password combination against a RADIUS
server, this will give you a stress-free interface.

There are a few alternatives[2][3][4], most of which sadly lack active
maintenance and/or have a boguous code base. Not implementing any
RADIUS logic again, but using the FreeRADIUS implementation, will
guarantee a stable code base.
